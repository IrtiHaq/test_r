# Evaluation
My main concern with the analysis is the fact that I feel that using linear regression was not the most appropriate. An ordinal logistic regression would have been better to use as we are dealing with an ordinal response variable, team performance. By using linear regression, we are treating it like it is an interval data and is continuous but in reality, it is ordinal and thus categorical, and this is especially relevant considering that we aren’t using a composite score for team performance and plus I personally feel like a 5-point Likert scale is not sufficiently granular or precise enough to treat like an interval variable and is more ordinal. Any thing over 7 points is precise enough to start to treat it like an interval scale.

Also in terms of the research design the variable in my opinion are bit too abstract like Task interdependence and Team cohesion. I feel like operationalizing them into more concrete and precise measures that correspond with or could act as a proxy for these variables e.g., "how many people are needed to complete this task ?" or "would you be able to do this own you ?" for task interdependence. All three variables are very abstract and could vary based on individual interpretation or bias or even skill level.
